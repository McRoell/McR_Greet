A few little hints for McR_Greet.

Version 0.8, 2019-12-17
Adjustment of the times - the evening now goes until 4:00 and not just until 24:00
Adding the current client version 1.13.03

Version 0.7, 2019-12-09
Minor changes to the descriptions.
The entire directory is overwritten when the addon is updated.
If you added your own texts please add the file mcr_customtxt.lua BEFORE
an update and then copy it back into the directory.

Version 0.6, 2019-12-08
This version offers the possibility to easily and quickly change the whole thing to your own
expand texts. Simply add the file mcr_customtxt_Template.lua
Open and edit with a text editor (e.g.: notepad.exe under Windows).
More explanations of how and why can be found there.
It is therefore no longer necessary to make adjustments directly in the script.
