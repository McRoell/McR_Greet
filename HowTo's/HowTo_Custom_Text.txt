#### Basics ####
There are three simple steps to success.

1. Read the instructions so that there are no problems later on.
2. Edit the mcr_customtxt.lua file with your phrases.
    It is important that you use this exact name for everything to work.
3. Make a backup of the file. Save them somewhere you will find them after 
    an update or a new installation of the addon and write it back to the 
    folder.

##### Instructions and a little background #####
Please only write in the areas provided and the specifications
for quotation marks, commas and curly brackets.
Otherwise there may be problems in the game.

There are four "time zones" for each of which you can write your own texts.
Each of these time zones is represented by a so-called variable.
1. 04:00 to 10:59 - Morning - MorTXTCust
2. 11:00 to 13:59 - Noon    - NooTXTCust
3. 14:00 to 17:59 - Daytime - DayTXTCust
4. 18:00 to 03:59 - Evening - EveTXTCust

Strictly speaking, these are not variables but arrays, since here
multiple values can be saved at once. This is HERE now though
incidental.

The names of the variables must not be changed.
How does it all work now?

The system follows a certain structure - one also speaks of one here
Syntax - which looks like this:
variable = {item1, item2, item3, etc.};

The commas separate the individual values. If a text is to be saved, must
be placed in quotation marks. The whole package will then come with
enclosed in curly brackets {} and a semicolon ; finished - in
Basically how a period ends a sentence.
So that you don't have to bother yourself with endlessly long lines, you can do the whole thing
split into multiple lines.

In our case it would look like this:
variable = {
            "Hello",
            "whoo,"
            "I greet you"
            };

There is no comma at the end of the last line of a section.

You can remove the comments (lines with -- at the beginning) or just leave them in...
