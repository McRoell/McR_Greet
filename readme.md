# McR Greet - Send greetings in the guild chat #

Simply run /mcrgreet as a console command or implement it in a macro to send hail's 
into the guild chat. A random text, suitable for the current time will be selected.
By editing the file mcr_customtxt_Template.lua you can add your own phrases. 
See HowTo Folder for a how-to.

Please make a backup of the file with your own phrases, once you have edited it, so 
your adjustments are not lost when you update or reinstall the add-on
